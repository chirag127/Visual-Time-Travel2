*   **Impact:** The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, denial of service).
*   **Proof of Concept (Optional):** If possible, provide a proof of concept (PoC) or exploit code.

We will acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours. We will then investigate the vulnerability and work on a fix as quickly as possible. We will keep you informed of our progress.

## Security Best Practices

This project follows security best practices to protect users and their data. These include:

*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection).
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to protect user accounts and data.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Code is written following secure coding practices to prevent common security flaws.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Least Privilege:** Access controls are implemented to ensure users and systems have only the necessary permissions.
*   **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):** An SBOM is generated for each build to track dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
