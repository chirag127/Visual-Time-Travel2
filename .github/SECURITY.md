## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us immediately.  Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

Please follow these steps:

1.  **Email:** Send an email to [Your Contact Email or Security Team Email Address] with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report: [Project Name]"
2.  **Details:** In your email, please include:
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, denial of service).
    *   Any suggested remediation.
3.  **Confidentiality:** Please keep the details of the vulnerability confidential until we have confirmed a fix and you are given permission to disclose it.

We will acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours. We will then work to:

*   Confirm the vulnerability.
*   Identify a fix.
*   Test the fix.
*   Release a patched version of the project.

We aim to address security vulnerabilities promptly. Our goal is to provide a secure and reliable platform for all users.

## Supported Versions

Use our project with the latest version. Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Security Best Practices

We adhere to security best practices, including but not limited to:

*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to protect user data and resources.
*   **Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** We conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are regularly updated to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Least Privilege:** Systems are designed using the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions.

## Security Tools and Practices

*   **Static Analysis:** Use of static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws during code review and CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Dynamic analysis and penetration testing are done during the development and before major releases.
*   **Automated Security Scans:** Automated security scans are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers.  If you report a vulnerability responsibly, we will:

*   Acknowledge your contribution.
*   Give credit for the discovery in our release notes (if you wish).

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
